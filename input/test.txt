[The exclusive skill 'Giant Body Transformation Lv. 6 is activated!]
Giant Body Transformation was used and Yoo Joonghyuk narrowed the
distance to the constellations in an instant. Yoo Joonghyuk shot forward
like a meteor.
By the time the General of Vanara realized the sword and hurriedly raised
his huge double-edged sword, his head was already cut by the Black
Heavenly Demon Sword and flying through the air.
[You dareâ€¦!]
The General of Vanara's eyes widened and he spoke in his true voice, even
with his cut neck.
Yoo Joonghyuk cut the flying head in half using the Black Heavenly
Demon Sword.
It was a ridiculous end.
The excessively concentrated magic power was melting Yoo Joonghyuk's
blood. It was the result of invoking transcendence stage three to the limit.
The maximum time he could stay in this state was 10 minutes. In these 10
minutes, Yoo Joonghyuk had to defeat everyone.
"Next."
The death of the General of Vanara was a great shock to the constellations.
The constellations didn't disappear with the death of their incarnation
bodies.
