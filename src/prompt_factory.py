‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST output ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanations, no text, ONLY the JSON array.

üìã FORMAT REQUIREMENT:
Your response must be EXACTLY this format: ["speaker1", "speaker2", "speaker3", ...]
- Must be valid JSON
- Must contain exactly {num_lines} strings
- Must use double quotes, not single quotes
- No trailing commas

üë• SPEAKER TYPES:
- "narrator" = Text describing actions, thoughts, or scenes
- Character names = Text spoken by characters (e.g., "John", "Sarah")  
- "AMBIGUOUS" = Cannot determine who is speaking

üî• KEY RULE: Character mentioned ‚â† Character speaking
- "John walked to the door" ‚Üí "narrator" (describes John)
- "I'm leaving," John said ‚Üí "John" (John speaks)

üìö EXAMPLES WITH EXACT REQUIRED OUTPUT:

Example 1:
[INPUT]
1. The storm was approaching fast.
2. "We need to take shelter," Sarah warned.
3. Everyone nodded in agreement.
[REQUIRED OUTPUT] ["narrator", "Sarah", "narrator"]

Example 2:
[INPUT]  
1. ALICE: This is impossible!
2. "What do you mean?"
3. The room fell silent.
[REQUIRED OUTPUT] ["Alice", "AMBIGUOUS", "narrator"]

Example 3:
[INPUT]
1. "Ready?" Tom asked nervously.
2. Lisa checked her equipment once more.
3. "Let's do this."
[REQUIRED OUTPUT] ["Tom", "narrator", "AMBIGUOUS"]

Example 4 - CHARACTER NAME vs SPEAKER:
[INPUT]
1. Marcus stepped into the arena.
2. The crowd was cheering for Marcus.
3. "I won't lose!" Marcus shouted.
4. Marcus's heart was pounding.
[REQUIRED OUTPUT] ["narrator", "narrator", "Marcus", "narrator"]

Example 5 - MIXED CONTENT:
[INPUT]
1. [System alert: Danger detected]
2. "Help us!"
3. The explosion shook the building.
