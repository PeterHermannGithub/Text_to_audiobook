## 🚀 Core Workflow

The application operates in a sequential, multi-phase process:

1.  **Phase 1: Text Extraction** *(Enhanced PDF Processing)*
    *   **Input:** A file path provided via command-line argument.
    *   **Process:** The `TextExtractor` class reads the file and extracts raw text content with advanced PDF filtering:
        - **Content Type Classification**: Automatically detects TOC, chapter headers, metadata, and story content
        - **Intelligent Content Filtering**: Skips table of contents, metadata sections, and chapter listings
        - **Story Content Detection**: Identifies actual narrative content using dialogue/narrative ratio analysis
        - **Multi-format Support**: `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.epub`, `.mobi` with format-specific optimizations
    *   **Output:** A single string of filtered, story-relevant raw text.

2.  **Phase 2: Text Structuring** *(Ultrathink Architecture)*
    *   **Input:** The raw text string.
    *   **Process:** The `TextStructurer` class orchestrates the following **deterministic-first** pipeline:
        *   **Preprocessing:** The `TextPreprocessor` analyzes raw text to extract structural hints like dialogue markers, scene breaks, and potential character names using spaCy NLP.
        *   **Chunking:** The `ChunkManager` creates large, overlapping chunks of raw text, prioritizing scene breaks and content boundaries.
        *   **Deterministic Segmentation:** The `DeterministicSegmenter` performs rule-based text segmentation with:
            - Multi-format support (script, mixed-script, narrative)
            - Advanced mixed-content detection (dialogue/narrative ratio analysis)
            - Aggressive segment splitting for segments >400 chars with mixed content
            - Comprehensive metadata filtering at segmentation level
        *   **Rule-Based Attribution:** The `RuleBasedAttributor` provides high-confidence speaker attribution using:
            - Script format patterns (`CHARACTER: dialogue`)
            - Dialogue attribution patterns (`"dialogue," speaker said`)
            - Character name presence detection with fuzzy matching
            - Metadata speaker filtering with comprehensive blacklists
        *   **LLM Classification:** The `LLMOrchestrator` handles only remaining AMBIGUOUS segments with pure speaker classification (no text modification)
        *   **Merging:** The `ChunkManager` intelligently merges the structured segments from each chunk, handling overlaps using fuzzy sequence matching.
        *   **Quality Validation:** The `SimplifiedValidator` analyzes speaker attribution quality focusing on consistency without text corruption risk.
        *   **Contextual Refinement:** The `ContextualRefiner` uses conversation flow analysis and contextual memory to resolve remaining AMBIGUOUS speakers.
    *   **Output:** A JSON file (`output/<book_name>.json`) containing a list of objects, where each object has a `speaker` and `text` key with detailed error tracking.

3.  **Phase 3: Voice Casting (Future)**
    *   **Input:** The structured JSON from Phase 2.
    *   **Process:** Will analyze the unique speakers and suggest appropriate TTS voices.
    *   **Output:** A `voice_profiles.json` configuration file.

4.  **Phase 4: Audio Generation (Future)**
    *   **Input:** The structured JSON and the `voice_profiles.json`.
    *   **Process:** Will use a TTS engine to generate audio for each text segment with the assigned voice.
    *   **Output:** A final audiobook file (e.g., `output.mp3`).

## 🛠️ How to Run & Develop

1.  **Setup Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to project root
    cd /mnt/c/Dev/Projects/text_to_audiobook

    # Create and activate venv if it doesn't exist
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Setup Local AI Server (Ollama - Manual Step for User):
    ```bash
    # (In a separate terminal) Install Ollama
    curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

    # (In a separate terminal) Pull models
    ollama pull mistral
    ollama pull llama3
    ```

3.  **Execute the Application:**
    *   Place a test file in the `/input` directory (e.g., `input/my_book.epub`).
    *   Run the app from the project root directory.

    ```bash
    # Run with default local model (defined in config/settings.py)
    python app.py input/my_book.epub

    # Run with a different local model (e.g., llama3, if pulled)
    python app.py input/my_book.epub --model llama3

    # Run with Google Cloud engine (requires credentials and project_id)
    python app.py input/my_book.epub --engine gcp --project_id "your-gcp-project-id"
    ```

---

## 🚨 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

*   **Ollama Connection Error:** Ensure the Ollama server is running. Run `ollama list` in a separate terminal to verify.
*   **Malformed JSON Output:** The `validate_and_parse` method in `llm_orchestrator.py` is the first place to debug. The prompt in `prompt_factory.py` may need to be adjusted for different models.
*   **Unsupported File Type:** Add a new read method and its file extension to the `supported_formats` dictionary in `text_extractor.py`.
*   **GCP Authentication:** Ensure the user has run `gcloud auth application-default login` and that the specified `project_id` is correct.
*   **spaCy Model Not Found:** If you see a warning about `en_core_web_sm` not found, run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` in your activated virtual environment.
